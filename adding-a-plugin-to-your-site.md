# Adding a Plugin to your site

Plugins allow you to customize the functionality of your site. You can and add 

* Portfolio-style grid
* Social media icon menu
* Contact form
* PDF document embedder
* Security
* And more

If there's something you'd like your site to do, there's a good chance someone developed a plugin to do it. Just Google whatever it is you’d like to do along with the words “WordPress” and “Plugin.” 

To be safe, always install plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. You can search for plugins by name and install them directly to your site.

1. From the Dashboard, click Plugins and choose Add New.
2. In the Install Plugins page, enter keyword terms for the type of plugin you would like to install (examples: “Contact form” or “social media”) and click Search Plugins.
3. Scroll through the list of plugins that appears. Click Details to get more information about a plugin.
4. If you find a plugin you’d like to add to your site, click Install Now.
5. When asked, “Are you sure you want to install this plugin?” click OK.
6. The plugin will download to your site and server space, but you will need to activate it before you can use it. Click Activate Plugin.
