# Adding a Plugin to your site

Plugins allow you to customize the functionality of your site. You can and add social media buttons, contact forms, document emebedders and more. 

If there's something you'd like your site to do, there's a good chance someone developed a plugin to do it. Just Google whatever it is you’d like to do along with the words “WordPress” and “Plugin.” 

To be safe, always install plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. You can search for plugins by name and install them directly to your site.
