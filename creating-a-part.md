# Creating a Page

Pages are different than Posts in that they (usually) appear in the navigation menu. They’re static. They don’t really change. Unlike a blog Post, the information in a Page pretty much stays the same.

1. From the Dashboard, click Pages and select Add New.
2. Enter a title for your Page. (By default, this will also be the name of the button associated with your page. You can change this, however.)
3. Use the Visual editor to add content to your Page. (Use the Text editor to add code to your Page.)
