# Switching from Dashboard to live site

The Dashboard controls the backend of your site. It’s what you see when you initially login to WordPress. As you work, you’ll need to switch back and forth between the Dashboard and your live site.

To switch between Dashboard and your live site:

1. Click your name in the upper left.
2. Choose Dashboard or Visit site (whichever one you want to use.)
