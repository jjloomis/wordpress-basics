# Adding a Featured Image to a Post

A Featured Image is an image that does not appear within a Post. The Featured Image appears alongside the Post Excerpt in the area of your site that displays Posts (the front page of your site, or a dedicated Blog page, for example.)

Most themes also display a large version of the Featured Image near the top the Post. For this reason, you should use a large image when adding a Featured Image to a Post.

1. In a Post, scroll down to the Featured Image area (on right.)
2. Click Set featured image. (You may need to click the downward-pointing arrow to expand this area.)
3. In the Featured Image dialog box, use the Upload tab to navigate to and select an image on your computer. Or, use the Media Library tab to use an image that was previously added to your site.
4. Click Set featured image.
5. When finished, click Update or Publish.
