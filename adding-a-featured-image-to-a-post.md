# Adding a Featured Image to a Post

A Featured Image is an image that does not appear within a Post. The Featured Image appears alongside the Post Excerpt in the area of your site that displays Posts (the front page of your site, or a dedicated Blog page, for example.)

Most themes also display a large version of the Featured Image near the top the Post. For this reason, you should use a large image when adding a Featured Image to a Post.
