# Working with content in the Visual editor

The Visual editor is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor similar to Microsoft Word.

To format text in the Visual editor, select the text and use the formatting tools at the top of the editor. 

1. When working with a Post or Page, make sure the Visual tab is selected.
2. You may need to click the Toolbar Toggle button (in the formatting toolbar) to see all of the formatting options.
3. To add content, click within the editor and type (or paste) your content. Note: If you're pasting content copied from an email or website, select Paste as text in the formatting toolbar.
4. Highlight text in the Visual editor and apply formatting using the formatting tools.
5. When finished, click Publish or Update.
