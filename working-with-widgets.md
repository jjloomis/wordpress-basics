# Working with Widgets

A widgetized area of a WordPress site usually displays Recent Posts, social media icons, a search bar, etc. These widgets often appear in the sidebar of a site. But different themes have different widgetized areas (in the header and/ or footer, for example.)

Widgets are optional. 

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and choose Widgets.
2. On the right, youâ€™ll see the Widgetized areas for your theme. To add a Widget to one of these areas, click the Widget's name. 
3. In the Widget's drop-down list, choose a Widgetized area and click Add Widget.
5. In the Widgetized area, click the expand button (black arrowhead) to give the Widget a title and/ or tweak its settings.
6. To remove a Widget, expand it in the Widgetized area and then click the Delete link. 

Note: The Widget area does not use a Save or Publish button. View your site in the browser to make sure your Widgets are set up and working correctly.
