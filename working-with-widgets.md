# Working with Widgets

Widgets area generally the area on your site that displays Recent Posts, a search bar, Recent Comments, etc. Usually, these appear on the sidebar of your site, but different themes allow for different widget areas (such as header and footer widgets.)

Depending on how you want to arrange your site, you may or may not want to use widgets.

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and choose Widgets.
2. On the right, youâ€™ll see the Widget areas for your theme. To add a Widget to one of these areas, click the Widget's name. 
3. In the Widget's drop-down list, choose a Widget area and click Add Widget.
5. In the Widget area, click the black arrowhead to expand the Widget. Use this area to give the Widget a title and/ or it settings (if you're using a social media plugin widget, for example.)
6. To remove a Widget, expand it in the Widget area and then click the Delete link. 

Note: The Widget area does not use a Save or Publish button. View your site in the browser to make sure your Widgets are set up and working correctly.
