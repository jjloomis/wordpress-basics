# Working with Widgets

Widgets area generally the area on your site that displays Recent Posts, a search bar, Recent Comments, etc. Usually, these appear on the sidebar of your site, but different themes allow for different widget areas (such as footer widgets.)

Depending on how you want to arrange your site, you may or may not want to use widgets.

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and choose Widgets.
2. On the right, youâ€™ll see the Widget areas available for your theme. To add a Widget to any of these areas, in the Available Widgets area, click the Widget name. From the drop-down list, choose a Widget area and click Add Widget.
3. To remove a Widget from a Widget area, click the Expand button next to the Widget area name. Then click the Delete button for that Widget.
4. The Widget area does not use a Save or Publish button. View your site in the browser to make sure your Widgets are working correctly.
