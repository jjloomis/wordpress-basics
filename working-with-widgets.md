# Working with Widgets

Widgets area generally the area on your site that displays Recent Posts, a search bar, Recent Comments, etc. Usually, these appear on the sidebar of your site, but different themes allow for different widget areas (such as header and footer widgets.)

Depending on how you want to arrange your site, you may or may not want to use widgets.

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and choose Widgets.
2. On the right, youâ€™ll see the Widgetized areas for your theme. To add a Widget to one of these areas, click the Widget's name. 
3. In the Widget's drop-down list, choose a Widgetized area and click Add Widget.
5. In the Widgetized area, click the expand button (black arrowhead) to give the Widget a title and/ or tweak its settings.
6. To remove a Widget, expand it in the Widgetized area and then click the Delete link. 

Note: The Widget area does not use a Save or Publish button. View your site in the browser to make sure your Widgets are set up and working correctly.
