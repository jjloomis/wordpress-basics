# Changing the order of Menu items

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and choose Menus.
2. Make sure the Edit Menus tab is selected.
3. In the Menu Structure area, click and drag menu items to rearrange the order in which they appear (be careful not to indent one menu item beneath another as this will cause it to be a sub item.)
4. When finished, scroll down and click Save Menu.
