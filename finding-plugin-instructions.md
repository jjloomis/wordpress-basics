# Finding plugin instructions

Plugin instructions are usually found on the plugin's WordPress Plugin Directory page.

1. Go to the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
2. In the Search plugins field, enter the name of a plugin. (Be exact. Plugins often have similar names.) Press Return.
3. On the search results page, find the plugin and go to its WordPress Plugin Directory page. Use the tabs (Desciption, Installation, FAQ, Screenshots) to find out how to set up and use the plugin.

Note: You most likely already installed and activated the plugin. If that's the case, skip any install and activate steps on the plugin's WordPress Plugin Directory page.
