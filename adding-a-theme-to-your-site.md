# Adding a theme to your site

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and then select Themes.
2. Click Add New.
3. Browse themes available on the WordPress Repository using the Featured, Popular and Latest tabs. To see all themes on the Repository, click within the Search themes… field (don’t type anything) and press Enter on your keyboard.
4. Use the Preview button to take a look at the theme. (This will not apply the theme to your site. It's a preview of how the theme works with images, text, and other elements.) 
5. When you’ve found a theme you would like to use, click Install. The theme will download to your WordPress site.
6. To apply the theme to your site, click Activate.
