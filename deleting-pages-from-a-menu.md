# Removing Pages from a Menu

1. From the Dashboard, click Appearance and choose Menus.
2. Make sure the Edit Menus tab is selected.
3. In the Menu Structure area, click the expand button (downward-pointing triangle) next to the name of the menu item you’d like to remove.
4. Click Remove (this does not delete the page—it only removes it from the menu.)
5. When finished, scroll down and click Save Menu.
